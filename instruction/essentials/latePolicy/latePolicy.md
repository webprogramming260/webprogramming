# Late Policy

Your success in this course is primarily based upon timely execution. Staying on track results in an enjoyable, positive experience. Once you get behind in the course, it is extremely difficult to catch up.

To help you stay current with the rest of the class, we will implement the following late policy:

## Late Submissions

Late submissions receive **zero** points. When determining if a submission is late, consider Sunday and Monday as one day.

## Grace Days

Each student begins the semester with **two grace days**. Grace days allow you to submit a deliverable past the assigned due date for full credit. Each grace day covers one day late. Grace days are calculated when the TA grades the assignment.

The one exception to the grace day policy is the **university deadline on the last day of instruction**. All work must be submitted by that time, with all missing work receiving a **zero** afterwards.

We encourage you to submit all work even if it is late. Most deliverables depend upon the previous ones in order to be successful, and you will gain helpful feedback for each submission, even if it earns zero points.

## Earning Grace Days

To encourage you to stay ahead of the course, and handle the inevitable sickness, family emergency, powder day, or accident, you can earn grace days.

For each day that a deliverable is submitted early, and receives 100%, Sundays excluded, you earn 1 grace day.

You can view your available grace days on the `Grace Days` assignment in Canvas.

## Examples

1. You have 2 grace days. You turn in an assignment in 1 day late for full credit. You now have 1 grace day.
2. You have 2 grace days. You turn in an assignment 3 days early. You now have 5 grace days.
3. You have 2 grace days. You turn in an assignment 3 days late. You receive no credit for the assignment. You still have 2 grace days.
4. You have 2 grace days. The assignment is due on Saturday. You turn it in on Monday. You now have 1 grace day.
5. You have 2 grace days. The assignment is due on Monday. You turn it in on Saturday. You now have 3 grace days.

## Extenuating Circumstances and Accommodations

Life happens, sometimes in ways we cannot foresee or prepare for. If you encounter an extenuating circumstance or require university accommodations during the semester, please contact the professor as soon as possible. University Accommodations require you to ask the Instructor for extensions **before** the deadline.
